Your best path can depend on your project, the complexity of your build tools, the version of Bootstrap you’re using, browser support, and more. Our two preferred methods are: Using Bootstrap
            via package manager so you can use and extend our source files. Using Bootstrap’s compiled distribution files or jsDelivr so you can add onto or override Bootstrap’s styles. While we cannot go into details here on how to use every package
            manager, we can give some guidance on using Bootstrap with your own Sass compiler. For those who want to use the distribution files, review the getting started page for how to include those files and an example HTML page. From there, consult
            the docs for the layout, components, and behaviors you’d like to use. As you familiarize yourself with Bootstrap, continue exploring this section for more details on how to utilize our global options, making use of and changing our color system,
            how we build our components, how to use our growing list of CSS custom properties, and how to optimize your code when building with Bootstrap.</p>
